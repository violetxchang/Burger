# Burger Chomp
Burger Chomp is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the burger will be displayed in the "Burgers To Be Chomped" listâ€”waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area has a "Devour It!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the "Chomped Burgers" list.

Made with mySQL, node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.
